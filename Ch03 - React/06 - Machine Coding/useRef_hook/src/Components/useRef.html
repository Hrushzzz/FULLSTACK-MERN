<!--

The useRef hook in React is a versatile and powerful tool that allows you to create a reference 
to a DOM element or a mutable variable that persists across re-renders without causing re-renders when it changes.

Key Features of useRef ::: 

=> Persistent Reference:
The useRef hook provides a mutable current property that retains its value across re-renders.
Unlike state, updating a ref does not trigger a re-render.

=> DOM Access:
It can be used to directly access and manipulate DOM elements, 
making it an essential tool for integrating third-party libraries or handling imperative actions.

=> Storing Mutable Variables:
It can store values that need to persist between renders but do not require re-rendering the component when changed.


Syntax :::
const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);


Common Use Cases :::
=> Accessing DOM Elements
=> Storing Previous Values
=> Integration with Third-Party Libraries


Key Notes :::
=> useRef does not notify you when its value changes (unlike state). 
    If you need to react to changes, you should use state instead.
=> While useRef can store any mutable value, avoid using it as a replacement for state if the value affects rendering.
=> useRef is a great tool for managing "side effects" in your components, 
    making it easier to work with DOM and mutable variables efficiently.
