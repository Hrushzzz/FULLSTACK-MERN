JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format 
that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write. 
It is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a client in web applications.

Key Features of JSON :::

=> Lightweight ::
JSON uses a minimal and simple syntax, making it efficient for data exchange.

=> Human-Readable ::
JSON's structure is easy to understand and write manually.

=> Language-Independent ::
Although derived from JavaScript, JSON is supported by almost all programming languages.
example:  Python, Java, C#, PHP.

=> Self-Describing ::
JSON's key-value pair structure makes it intuitive and self-explanatory.


Structure of JSON :::

JSON data is structured as key-value pairs, where:

Keys are always strings (enclosed in double quotes "").
Values can be:
A string
A number
An object (another set of key-value pairs)
An array (a list of values)
A boolean (true or false)
null


JSON Syntax Example :::

{
  "name": "Hrushikesh",
  "age": 25,
  "isEmployed": true,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "React", "Java"],
  "address": {
    "street": "Krishna Nagar",
    "city": "Kurnool",
    "zipCode": "518218"
  }
}

name: A string value.
age: A number value.
isEmployed: A boolean value.
skills: An array of strings.
address: An object containing nested key-value pairs.


Why Use JSON? :::

=> Data Interchange ::
JSON is often used in APIs to send and receive data between a client (e.g., browser) and a server.

=> Easier to Parse ::
Most programming languages have built-in libraries for parsing JSON into native data structures
(like dictionaries or objects).

=> Compatibility ::
JSON can be used with databases (e.g., MongoDB stores data in JSON-like format), 
configuration files, or data storage.


JSON vs XML :::

Feature	    :          JSON	               -           XML
Syntax	    :   Lightweight and simple	   -     Verbose and complex
Readability	:   Easier for humans	       -     Harder to read
Data Types	:   Supports various types	   -     Only text
Parsing     :	Faster and easier	       -     Slower and more complex


JSON has become the standard format for web applications because of its simplicity,
efficiency, and wide compatibility.
