// State ::: State in React is a built-in object that holds data specific to a component.
// It represents the internal data that can change over time and directly influences how a component renders and behaves.


// State allows components to manage dynamic data and update the UI accordingly
//  based on user interactions / network requests or any other event. 

// Props are passed down from Parent to Child and are Immutable.


// When to Use State :::

// 1. Dynamic Data: 
// Use state when you have data that changes over time without requiring a full page reload.
// examples: User input forms, Toggle switches, Counters, Dynamic lists

// 2. User Interactions: 
// State is crucial for managing UI interactions:
// examples: Showing/hiding elements, Tracking selected items, Managing modal or dropdown visibility

// 3. Storing Component-Specific Information:
// When a component needs to keep track of its own data that might change.
// examples: Form input values, Current step in a multi-step process, Selected filters
