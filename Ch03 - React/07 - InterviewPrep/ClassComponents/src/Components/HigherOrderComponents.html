==> Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React :::
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a design pattern in React for reusing component logic. 
It is a function that takes a component as an input and returns a new component with additional props or behaviors 
that enhances or wraps the original one.


==> Purpose of HOCs :::
1. Code Reusability: Share common logic across multiple components.
2. Separation of Concerns: Keep the core logic separate from the UI components.
3. Cross-Cutting Concerns: Handle things like authentication, analytics, or theming.


==> Common Use Cases :::
1. Access Control (Authentication): Wrap components to check if the user is logged in before rendering.
2. Theming: Pass theme-related props to components.
3. Enhancing Components: Add logging, error boundaries, or state management to components.


==> Key Points :::
1. Pure Functions: HOCs are pure functions—they don't modify the original component, they enhance it by creating a new component.
2. Props Handling: Always pass down props to the wrapped component using {...this.props}.
3. Wrapper Hell: Overuse of HOCs can lead to deeply nested wrappers, making debugging harder.


==> Alternatives to HOCs :::
With the introduction of React Hooks, many use cases of HOCs can be implemented using custom hooks, 
which provide a simpler and more readable approach.

example:
Instead of using an HOC for state or data fetching, you can use a custom hook (useState, useEffect, or custom hooks).


==> Summary:
HOCs are a powerful tool for reusing logic in React, especially in class-based components. 
However, with modern React features like hooks, they are less frequently needed but remain useful for certain advanced patterns.
