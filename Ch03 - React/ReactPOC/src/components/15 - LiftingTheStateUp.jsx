Lifting the State Up :::

When there is a "state" required my multiple siblings, that state is moved towards the "Parent"
 and that Parent can take the control of the "state" and distribute/give it to the siblings/children.

The Parent can send that state to the Chilren as "Props". 

Props cannot be passed within children/siblings or from Children to Parent, but can be passed from Parent to Children.

This phenomena is called as "Lifting the state up". 

Example for "Lifting the state up" is written in "Temperature Input and Display" problem.
