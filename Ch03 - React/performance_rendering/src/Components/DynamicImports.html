=====>  Loading code in smaller chunks is called as "CODE SPLITTING".


Dynamic imports in React are a powerful feature that allows you to load components or modules on-demand, 
which can significantly improve your application's initial load time and performance. 
Unlike standard static imports, dynamic imports enable you to load JavaScript modules asynchronously when they are needed.


==> What are Dynamic Imports? :::

Dynamic imports are a way to load JavaScript modules lazily, 
meaning the code is only downloaded and parsed when it's actually required. 
In React, this is typically implemented using React.lazy() and Suspense.


==> Key Concepts :::

1. **React.lazy()**
   - Used to create a dynamically imported component
   - Takes a function that returns a Promise
   - The Promise should resolve to a module with a default export of a React component

2. **Suspense**
   - A React component that lets you show a fallback UI while waiting for something to load
   - Works seamlessly with lazy-loaded components
   - Provides a way to handle the loading state gracefully

   
==> Benefits of Dynamic Imports :::

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduces initial bundle size
   - Loads code only when necessary
   - Faster initial page load times

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Break large applications into smaller chunks
   - Load different parts of the app on-demand


==> Considerations :::

- Dynamic imports work best with modern build tools like Webpack
- They're supported in Create React App out of the box
- Some bundlers require specific configuration for optimal code splitting

==> Best Practices :::

1. Use dynamic imports for large components or routes
2. Always provide a fallback UI with Suspense
3. Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
4. Be mindful of the performance impact of too many dynamic imports


Dynamic imports are a powerful technique to optimize React application performance, 
allowing you to load components and modules only when they are needed, 
resulting in faster initial load times and a more efficient application architecture.
